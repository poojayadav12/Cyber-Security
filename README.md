# Cyber-Security 

## **Our Web Application has the following features:**</br>
1. Our prototype has a login and sign-up feature with our own database which stores passwords in hashed format.</br>
2. It is a responsive application and works well on laptop, mobile and tablets.</br>
3. In our prototype we have come up with a 2-way verification of the authenticity of the card holder who is making the payment. 
You have to enter 2 OTP's while completing the transaction. One that you will receive on your registered e-mail id and one which you receive on your registered mobile number.</br>
4. On successfully verifying both the OTP's your transaction will be completed.</br>
5. We also have an idea of extending our project so that it also has a biometric verification option on mobile devices and pattern verification option similar to one on our mobile phones. We can also incorporate gesture recognition using AI as the technology advances.</br>
6. We have deployed our application on heroku. Please click on [Link](https://safe-pay.herokuapp.com/index.html) to view.
